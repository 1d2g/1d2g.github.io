      "description": "The current earnings call does not indicate any spin-offs or divestitures; however, it highlights a general commitment to maintaining brand integrity and portfolio optimization. Hormel has positions focusing on efficiency improvements, scaling up production, and ensuring sustainable growth for its core brands, but no divestiture plans or spin-offs were discussed during the call. Consequently, the company appears to be consolidating its efforts to strengthen its current market positioning rather than fragmenting its asset base."
